## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to practicing and enhancing my skills in Angular, a popular front-end web framework developed by Google. Here, I work on various projects and exercises to deepen my understanding of building dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) using Angular.

### Goals and Learning Objectives

- **Practice Component-Based Architecture**: Creating modular and reusable components to build efficient and maintainable applications.
- **Master Two-Way Data Binding**: Implementing automatic synchronization between the model and the view to streamline user interactions and UI updates.
- **Utilize Dependency Injection**: Effectively managing and injecting services and dependencies into components to enhance application architecture.
- **Explore Directives and Pipes**: Leveraging Angular's powerful directives and pipes to extend and transform DOM elements and data.
- **Implement Routing**: Developing seamless navigation between views or components to create rich, single-page applications.
- **Apply RxJS for Reactive Programming**: Utilizing RxJS for managing asynchronous operations and reactive data streams.

### Staying Updated with Angular

As part of my continuous learning, I aim to keep up with the latest Angular features and updates:

- **Standalone Components**: Simplifying development by using components without NgModules.
- **Hydration for SSR**: Improving server-side rendering performance with better hydration support.
- **ESBuild Integration**: Leveraging ESBuild for faster build processes and smaller bundle sizes.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Utilizing the latest tools and improvements in Angular CLI and debugging workflows.
- **Angular Ivy**: Benefiting from the default Ivy renderer for faster compilation and smaller bundles.

This repository serves as a record of my journey and progress in mastering Angular, showcasing various projects and experiments as I explore the framework's capabilities and advancements.
